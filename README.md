ErrorHandlingContract
ErrorHandlingContract is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for error handling in Ethereum smart contracts.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple example of how to handle errors and exceptional conditions in Solidity smart contracts using the built-in error handling functions: require(), assert(), and revert(). By understanding these error handling mechanisms, developers can write more secure and robust smart contracts that handle unexpected situations gracefully.

Functionality
The ErrorHandlingContract implements two main functions:

deposit(uint256 amount): Allows users to deposit funds into their account balance. It ensures that the amount to be deposited is greater than zero using require(). If the condition is not met, the transaction will be reverted with an appropriate error message.

withdraw(uint256 amount): Allows users to withdraw funds from their account balance. It uses assert() to check if the contract has sufficient balance before processing the withdrawal. If the contract balance is less than the amount requested to be withdrawn, the transaction will be reverted using revert() with an error message indicating "Insufficient balance."

Getting Started
To use the ErrorHandlingContract, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have the required development environment set up with Solidity compiler and a compatible Ethereum development framework like Truffle or Hardhat.

Deploy the ErrorHandlingContract on your local Ethereum development network or testnet.

Interact with the contract by calling the deposit and withdraw functions, providing the required inputs and observing the error handling mechanisms in action.

Example Usage
solidity
Copy code
// Deploy the ErrorHandlingContract
ErrorHandlingContract contractInstance = ErrorHandlingContract();

// Deposit 100 wei to the contract
contractInstance.deposit{value: 100}(100);

// Try to withdraw 150 wei from the contract
contractInstance.withdraw(150); // This will revert with "Insufficient balance" error message

// Withdraw 50 wei from the contract
contractInstance.withdraw(50); // Successful withdrawal
